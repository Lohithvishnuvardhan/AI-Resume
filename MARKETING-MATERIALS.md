## 💡 PRO TIPS

### For Better Screenshots:
1. Use real, professional-looking sample data (not "John Doe")
2. Show completed, polished results (not empty forms)
3. Capture at 100% zoom (no browser UI visible)
4. Use light mode for main screenshots (more professional)
5. Clear browser cache for clean, fast-loading screenshots
6. Disable browser extensions that might appear
7. Use incognito/private mode for clean captures

### For Better Thumbnails:
1. Keep text large and readable (min 24px for body text)
2. Use high contrast (dark text on light background)
3. Show actual product interface (not just text)
4. Include 3-5 key features max (don't overcrowd)
5. Use professional colors (avoid purple!)
6. Test thumbnail at small size (looks good at 200px wide?)

### For Better Sales:
1. Show results, not features (beautiful resume > "has templates")
2. Use numbers (50+ templates > "many templates")
3. Highlight pain point solutions (ATS optimized > "good formatting")
4. Show before/after if possible
5. Use social proof when available
6. Clear, single call-to-action
